This is a patch for R v2.16.0 (Unsuffered Consequences)
that provides layered output for the pdf() graphics device.

to install:
cd [R-root]
patch -p1<add_pdf_layers.diff

The patch updates all the regression tests in 'make check'
so they pass without noise with respect to what has changed.

As of yet there is no automated test to check for proper 
function of the layers in pdf().

To use: 
>pdf("file/name", onepage=TRUE)
>plot(a figure)       #layer 0 (background)
>plot(another figure) #layer 1 (foreground)
>[continue...]
>dev.off()

Layers will render as expected in viewers such based on poppler
and such, also in Adobe reader products.

In Adobe professional products (CS# etc) the layers will appear 
as analogous clipping groups.
